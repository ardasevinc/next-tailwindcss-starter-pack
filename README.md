This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with tailwind and typescript installed and all set up!

I recently started learning Next and tailwind but all the templates I would find had lots of dependencies
that I was not using. So I created this.

## Getting Started

Run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:300](http://localhost:3000)

## Next Steps

The only thing remaining is to have fun!
